- ❌ **No clear explanation** of data usage at signup
- ❌ **No opt-out options** for non-essential data collection

### Transparency
- ❌ **No data usage explanation** on registration forms
- ❌ **No clear disclosure** about who can access data
- ⚠️ **Admin verification process** not explained to students

## 10. CONCLUSION

- ✅ Explicit consent mechanism
- ✅ Privacy policy documenting practices
- ✅ Terms & conditions with data rights
- ⚠️ User control features (in progress)

**Risk Level:** Reduced from **HIGH** to **MEDIUM** (still need user control features)
